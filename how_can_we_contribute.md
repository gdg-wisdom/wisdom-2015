# How can we contribute?

## Types of Contributions

There are many ways to contribute but three key ones are:

### Suggest Content.
- Have you had questions that you wished you had answers to? Are there resources or references that you wish were made available to you in a central location? **Submit them!**

### Author Content.
- See a question that you can answer or are an expert on? **Answer it!** 
- See an answer that you can improve, build upon, or provide an alternative perspective to? **Edit it!** 
- See ways to organize content better, improve the writing style for clarity or simply make the reading experience easier? **Improve it!**

###Review Content.
- Have feedback on the accuracy, clarity or relevance of existing content? **Flag it** and tell us what you think.


## The Contribution Process

The original [How to contribute](https://sites.google.com/site/gdgwisdom/home) section is referenced here for historical reasons only. Going forward, we propose to handle all contributions via GitHub as follows.

**Want to edit content along these lines?** All you need is a GitHub account.

* Visit the [GDG Wisdom GitBook](http://gdg-wisdom.gitbooks.io/gdg-wisdom-2015/content/) and click "Edit This Page" on the corresponding page that you want to modify.
* You will be asked to log into your GitHub account to make edits.
* Commit the edits. (This will trigger a pull request to our repository)
* You're done. You will automatically be listed in our [GDG Wisdom contributors](https://github.com/gdg-wisdom/wisdom-2015/graphs/contributors) Dashboard.

You can find a viualisation of the process [here](https://www.lucidchart.com/documents/view/beb82d5c-7651-4f20-8e4b-27af0adbf488).
